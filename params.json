{"name":"Glide","tagline":"An image loading and caching library for Android focused on smooth scrolling","body":"Glide\r\n=====\r\nGlide is an all in one image download and resizing library for Android that wraps image downloading, resizing, memory and disk caching, and bitmap recycling into one simple and easy to use interface. Glide includes an implementation for fetching images over http based on Google's Volley project for fast, parallelized network operations on Android.\r\n\r\nGlide works best for long lists or grids where every item contains an image or images, but it's also effective for almost any case where you need to fetch, resize, and display a remote image.\r\n\r\nHow do I use Glide?\r\n-------------------\r\nThe GitHub project wiki has tutorials on a variety of topics, including basic usage and adding Glide to a project. The javadocs for version 1.0+ will also be available via a link on the wiki.\r\n\r\nSimple use cases will look something like this:\r\n\r\n```Java\r\n\r\n@Override\r\npublic View getView(int position, View recycled, ViewGroup container) {\r\n    final ImageView myImageView;\r\n    if (recycled == null) {\r\n        myImageView = (ImageView) inflater.inflate(R.layout.my_image_view, container, false);\r\n    } else {\r\n        myImageView = (ImageView) recycled);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    URL myUrl = myUrls.get(position);\r\n\r\n    Glide.load(myUrl).into(myImageView).centerCrop().animate(R.anim.fade_in).begin();\r\n\r\n    return myImageView;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nStatus\r\n------\r\nGlide has been in use at Bump for about six months in two of our Android apps. The API after 1.0 is mostly stable though there may be some superficial changes. Comments/bugs/questions/pull requests welcome!\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n------\r\nThanks to the Android project and Jake Wharton for the [disk cache implementation](https://github.com/JakeWharton/DiskLruCache) included with Glide.\r\nThanks also to Android team for [Volley](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/volley/)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
